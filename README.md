## 🧠 Learning Science + 🤖 AI Integration

### 📚 Spaced Repetition System (SRS) — *Science-Backed Scheduling with AI Precision*
- Based on the **SM-15 algorithm**, a spaced repetition method proven to optimize memory retention.
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: Cards are scheduled at scientifically ideal intervals to flatten the forgetting curve.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: Learner performance (0-5 rating) is processed by the AI to dynamically adjust each card's **easiness factor** and **next review date** in real time.
- 🚀 Consecutive successes trigger AI-optimized longer intervals for efficient mastery.

### 🧩 Active Recall — *Retrieval Practice, Amplified*
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: You first attempt to **recall** answers from memory without seeing hints — a core strategy for strengthening long-term retention.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: After self-assessment (0–5), the AI uses your feedback to adapt future recall challenges, ensuring questions stay in the sweet spot of **desirable difficulty**.

### 🔀 Interleaved Practice — *Cross-Topic Learning, Personalized*
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: Mixing problems from different topics builds more flexible, transferable knowledge.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: AI shuffles and selects cards **across decks** strategically — not just randomly — to ensure cognitive variability and optimize learning patterns.

### 🧑‍🏫 AI Tutor Mode — *Adaptive Feedback and Scaffolding*
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: Immediate, targeted feedback accelerates learning and helps correct errors before they solidify.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: An AI tutor engages you in **natural conversations**, adapts questions based on your past answers, and provides **conceptual explanations** precisely when you need them — promoting deeper understanding rather than shallow memorization.

### 📊 Content Analysis — *Knowledge Gaps, Diagnosed by AI*
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: Awareness of knowledge gaps is key for efficient learning.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: AI analyzes your deck content to spot missing connections, recommends additional flashcards for weak areas, and critiques question formulation for clarity, depth, and atomicity.

### 📨 Personalized Reminders — *Memory Consolidation through Timely Nudges*
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: Timely review sessions enhance long-term memory encoding.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: AI crafts personalized email reminders based on your review history, learning speed, and emotional engagement style (serious, playful, poetic) — even embedding **images** or **audio** for dual coding effects.

### 🗂️ Deck Analysis — *Progress Tracking that Fuels Growth*
- 🧠 *Learning Science*: Reflecting on learning progress improves motivation and metacognition.
- 🤖 *AI Application*: The system runs regular diagnostics on your decks, finds underrepresented areas, recommends strategic expansion, and visualizes your improvement patterns.
